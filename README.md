# Slick API

### An API for Slack-like messages

#### Version 1 documentation

# Local Setup

#### Run the following from your terminal. The last command will fill the database with fake conversations, messages, and users. Leave it off if you want to start with an empty database.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:trivett/slick.git
$ cd slick
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create && rake db:schema:load
$ rake db:seed 
```

#### Edit your hosts file

* Run the following command:

```
$ sudo vim  /etc/hosts

```
* Insert `127.0.0.1Â»api.slick.dev` to the hosts file to enable the API to run locally on a subdomain. The root of the project will be `https://api.slick.dev:3000/` when the server runs.

* Run the server: 

```
$ rails s

```

* You are now ready to issue requests to the API, which responds only with JSON.
